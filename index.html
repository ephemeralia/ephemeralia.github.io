CSS grid systems are typically built in one of two ways today—<code>float</code>s or some <code>display: inline-block;</code> hackery. Both are fine and well established, but <code>table</code>s are way fucking cooler. They give us some awesome power with the <code>table-layout</code> property and offer dead simple vertical centering.</blockquote>
