ephemeralia.github.io
=====================
This is really all about the content listed here. It is acknowledged that this content is obtusely organized. I struggle with remembering / keeping track of / documenting / bookmarking / referring-to-later across browsers and devices all of the great resources every day brings.

This page started by viewing the source of Bower.io/search and digging its nice and clever design. Plus I liked how shitforbuildingwebsites.com uses articles in list items.

In addition to working with design, this also represents working with GitHub and a custom url. Of all the domains I have lying around, ephemeralia.com was the closest in meaning to listing resources.

Main thing is that the content is useful. No doubt lots of it is familiar to you. Probably some of it's not.

Cheers
