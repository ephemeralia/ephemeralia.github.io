ephemeralia.github.io
=====================
Maintained by @bzelip.

This is really all about the content listed here. It is acknowledged that this content is obtusely organized. I struggle with remembering / keeping track of / documenting / bookmarking / referring-to-later all of the great resources every day brings across browsers and devices. That's why this exists.

This page started by viewing the source of Bower.io/search and digging its nice and clever design. Plus I liked how shitforbuildingwebsites.com uses articles in list items.

In addition to working with design, this also represents working with GitHub and a custom url. Of all the domains I have lying around, ephemeralia.com was the closest in meaning to listing resources.

_What about the overhead cost of maintaining it?_ My involvement with the community has me working with content management systems. In contrast, this is an outlet to quickly write HTML with [emmet](https://github.com/emmetio/emmet) and publish with `git`.

Main thing is that the content is useful. No doubt lots of it is familiar to you. Probably some of it's not.

Cheers
